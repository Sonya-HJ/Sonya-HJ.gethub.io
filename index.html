                    <p>Riley was adopted from the Blount County Animal Shelter in Alabama on April 11th, 2021. He was 8 weeks old and found with his litter on the side of the road. I chose him outof all of his littermates because when his sister got scared by a loud noise, he nuzzled his head against hers, she calmed down.</p>
