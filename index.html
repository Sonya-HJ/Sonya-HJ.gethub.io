                            <p>Riley was adopted from the Blount County Animal Shelter in Alabama on April 11th, 2021. He was 8 weeks old and found with his litter on the side of the road. I chose him outof all of his littermates because when his sister got scared by a loud noise, he nuzzled his head against hers, she calmed down.</p>

                            <p>One of the first outings Riley and I went on was to lake Nichol. His harness was so small, but it came in handy when he accidently fell in! He is still afraid of the water.</p>

                            <p>Riley got to go to puppy training classes at Petsmart. He learned a bunch of tricks and made three new friends. Some of the tricks he learned are: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>sit</li>
                                <li>down</li>
                                <li>wait</li>
                                <li>touch</li>
                                <li>come</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>He doesn't have all of them mastered (sometimes he pretends to not even know his name), but he likes to practice! Every morning when he gets his breakfast, he has to wait until I say "Ok!" before he can eat.</p>

                            <p>In May, Riley and I flew to Iowa to see my family. It was quite the adventure taking a puppy on a plane, but he did so well! He also did a great job meeting my older puppy, Tanner, and my grandparents. It always annoys my mother when dogs are on the counter (pup-top), so he had to be initiated.</p>
